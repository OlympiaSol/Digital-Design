# VHDL Laboratory Exercises

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of VHDL laboratory exercises designed for "Designing Digital Systems using a PC" with Quartus Altera. The exercises include 8 labs focusing on creating testbenches and circuits to understand the fundamentals of VHDL programming and digital system design.

## Lab Exercises
- **Lab 1**: Introduction to Quartus environment and simple digital circuits.
- **Labs 2-8**: Each lab focuses on progressively more complex designs, culminating in comprehensive projects involving testbenches and simulations.

## Requirements
- Quartus II (version 13.0sp1 or later) installed.
- Basic knowledge of digital design and VHDL.

## Acknowledgments
These exercises are designed to provide hands-on experience with VHDL programming, fostering skills in designing and simulating digital circuits using Quartus Altera.
